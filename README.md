# Coremedia-Magento Integration 

This open-source code is part of a tutorial designed to guide you through the process of connecting any commerce system to CoreMedia LiveContext. We're using the open-source Magento system to demonstrate the power of our LiveContext features and the ease of the integration. 

The tutorial involves installing a basic open-source Magento system with the default Luma storefront as example content. Then we show you step-by-step how to integrate CoreMedia with the Magento system. See the [wiki](../../wiki) for details.

For current CoreMedia customers, can follow the tutorial to integrate the CoreMedia-Magento extension code into your CoreMedia system and at the end, you should have a full CoreMedia system running fully integrated with the Magento system. You can then use all the powerful features of CoreMedia LiveContext to manage store and product catalog content. 

For people who are curious about CoreMedia and would like to see what we're capable of with commerce integrations, we've provided test content and the CoreMedia widgets so that you can enhance Magento's Luma storefront in a few easy steps. We've also prepared a couple videos so that you can see what the integration looks like on the CoreMedia side.

# CoreMedia Labs

Welcome to CoreMedia Labs! This repository is part of a platform for developers who want to have a look under the hood or get some hands-on understanding of the vast and compelling capabilities of CoreMedia. Whatever your experience level with CoreMedia is, we've got something for you.

Each project in our Labs platform is an extra feature to be used with CoreMedia, including extensions, tools and 3rd party integrations. We provide some test data and explanatory videos for non-customers and for insiders there is open-source code and instructions on integrating the feature into your CoreMedia workspace. 

The code we provide is meant to be example code, illustrating a set of features that could be used to enhance your CoreMedia experience. We'd love to hear your feedback on use-cases and further developments! If you're having problems with our code, please refer to our issues section.
